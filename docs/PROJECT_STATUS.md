# JobFillr Project Status Report

## Project Overview

JobFillr is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the job application process by automating form-filling across various job websites. The project consists of two main components:

1. **Web Portal**: A centralized platform for users to manage their personal information, upload resumes, and access their profile.
2. **Browser Extension**: A tool that integrates with job application websites to automatically fill forms using the user's stored data.

Key objectives include:
- Secure storage of user information
- AI-powered resume parsing
- Intelligent form field mapping on job sites
- Duplicate entry prevention
- One-click form filling functionality
- Dark mode cyberpunk-themed UI

## Lessons Learned

1. **Firebase Integration Complexity**: Integrating Firebase with server-side authentication required careful token management and verification.

2. **Context API Conflicts**: The React Context API can lead to unexpected behavior when multiple contexts interact, especially with asynchronous operations like resume uploads.

3. **Deduplication Challenges**: Creating robust deduplication for varied data formats requires multiple layers of validation and normalization.

4. **OpenAI Resume Parsing**: The OpenAI API is effective at extracting structured data from documents but requires careful prompt engineering and validation.

5. **State Management**: Keeping server and client-side state in sync requires careful planning and clear data flow patterns.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix the resume upload duplication issue by completely isolating the upload process from any React contexts
2. Improve form field auto-filling in the extension:
   - Debug and enhance the field mapping algorithm 
   - Add better visual feedback when fields are filled
   - Create a preview interface to show which data is being used
3. Clean up extension UI issues:
   - Remove duplicate sign-in buttons
   - Fix missing logo/icon issues
   - Improve the feedback when fields are detected/filled
   - Add clearer profile data visualization

### Longer-term Direction
1. Develop machine learning model for form field classification
2. Refine intelligent field mapping algorithm
3. Build extension UI with form preview and edit capabilities
4. Implement secure communication between extension and web portal
5. Test and optimize extension on major job sites
6. Create common job questions templates for tech fields

## Bug Reports
