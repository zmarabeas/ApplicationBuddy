# JobFillr Project Documentation

## Overview
JobFillr is an intelligent job application automation platform that streamlines the hiring process through AI-powered resume parsing, template-based responses, and browser extension auto-filling capabilities.

**Current Status**: Ready for Vercel deployment with complete template system implementation

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Wouter routing, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Express.js with Firebase Authentication, Firestore database, OpenAI integration
- **Extension**: Browser extension with form detection and auto-fill capabilities
- **Database**: Firestore with Drizzle ORM schema management
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o for resume parsing and content processing

## Recent Changes (January 2025)
âœ“ **Templates System Completed** - Full implementation with 16+ question templates across 6 categories
âœ“ **Navigation Fixed** - Resolved DOM nesting issues with Wouter Link components
âœ“ **API Endpoints Functional** - All template and user answer endpoints working correctly
âœ“ **Deployment Configuration** - Created vercel.json and deployment documentation
âœ“ **GDPR Compliance** - Data export/deletion APIs and privacy policy implemented
âœ“ **Rate Limiting** - Comprehensive rate limiting across all endpoints
âœ“ **Resume Processing** - AI-powered parsing with duplicate prevention

## User Preferences
- Prefers straightforward technical communication
- Focus on deployment readiness and production configuration
- Wants comprehensive documentation for handoff to other AI agents

## Key Features Implemented
1. **User Authentication** - Firebase-based with session management
2. **Resume Upload & Parsing** - AI extraction of structured data from PDF/DOCX
3. **Template System** - Pre-built responses for common job application questions
4. **Browser Extension** - Auto-fill capability with form field detection
5. **Profile Management** - Comprehensive user profiles with completion tracking
6. **GDPR Compliance** - Data export, deletion, and privacy controls
7. **Security** - Rate limiting, input validation, token-based authentication

## Phase Status
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: âœ… Complete - Bugs fixed, security implemented
- **Phase 2 (Templates)**: âœ… Complete - Template system fully functional
- **Phase 3 (Deployment)**: ðŸš€ In Progress - Ready for Vercel deployment

## Deployment Requirements
All necessary configuration files created:
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Comprehensive technical overview
- `SECRETS_AND_KEYS.md` - Complete environment variables list

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel using provided configuration
2. Set up production database (Neon PostgreSQL recommended)
3. Configure all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Test all functionality in production environment
5. Package and deploy browser extension to Chrome/Firefox stores

## Technical Notes
- Uses Firestore for data storage with transaction-based duplicate prevention
- OpenAI integration requires GPT-4o model for optimal resume parsing
- Browser extension uses content script injection for form detection
- Rate limiting configured for production use (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- All sensitive data properly encrypted and secured via Firebase Auth
